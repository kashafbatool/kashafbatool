## Hi, I’m Kashaf 👋

**CS ∪ Math student at haverford and bryn mawr  
interested in systems, problem-solving, and building things that actually matter.

I spend most of my time learning how ideas move from theory → code → impact.
Sometimes that means debugging for hours, sometimes it means rethinking the problem entirely.

---

## what I care about 🌍

- using computer science + math to **solve real problems**
- writing code that is **clear, thoughtful, and maintainable**
- learning deeply instead of rushing results
- contributing to things bigger than myself through **open source**

---

## open source & community 🤝

I believe open source is one of the most powerful ways to learn and give back.

- 🧩 contributing to open source projects (small fixes, features, documentation)
- 🔍 reading other people’s code to learn better patterns and practices
- 🌱 learning how collaboration, review, and iteration work at scale

Always open to contributing more and learning from the community.

---

## what I’m working on 🚀

- 🧠 strengthening foundations in **data structures & algorithms**
- 📱 building small apps and tools to solve everyday problems
- 🎨 exploring UI/UX to make technical tools feel more human
- ✍️ writing and thinking publicly about tech, learning, and growth

---

## how I think about code 🧩

- simplicity > clever hacks  
- understanding > memorization  
- people > abstractions  

Good code should feel calm to read.

---

## tools & tech 🛠️

- **Languages:** Java, Python  
- **Interests:** DSA, recursion, trees, graphs, OOP  
- **Currently learning:** deeper systems thinking & better design patterns  
- **Editor:** Vim (intentionally)

## my cozy corner of the internet

I write on **Substack** about:
- learning computer science & math  
- building projects from scratch  
- reflections on growth, tech, and problem-solving
