## Hi, I’m Kashaf 👋

- CS @ Haverford, Math @ Bryn Mawr 
- Drawn to AI, Robotics, Embedded Software and NLP
- Learning how ideas move from theory → code → impact

## open source & community 🤝

I believe open source is one of the most powerful ways to learn and give back.

- 🧩 contributing to open source projects (small fixes, features, documentation)
- 🔍 reading other people’s code to learn better patterns and practices
- 🌱 learning how collaboration, review, and iteration work at scale

Always open to contributing more and learning from the community.

## what I’m working on 🚀

- 🧠 strengthening foundations in **data structures & algorithms**
- 📱 building small apps and tools to solve everyday problems
- 🎨 exploring UI/UX to make technical tools feel more human
- ✍️ writing and thinking publicly about tech, learning, and growth

## how I think about code 🧩

- simplicity > clever hacks  
- understanding > memorization  
- people > abstractions  

Good code should feel calm to read.

- **Interests:** DSA, recursion, trees, graphs, OOP  
- **Currently learning:** deeper systems thinking & better design patterns  
- **Editor:** Vim (intentionally)
